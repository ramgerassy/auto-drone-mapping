# Project progress & decision log

A running journal of non-obvious decisions, trade-offs, and thoughts worth
remembering — the *why* behind choices that the code and git history don't
capture on their own. Newest entries at the top. Each entry records what was

## 2026-08-01 — `detect_frontiers` performance options (A / B / C / D)

Reviewed whether frontier detection is a heavy calculation. It isn't: overall
cost is **O(N + F)** — an O(N) *vectorized* numpy pass over all `N` grid cells
(runs in C) plus O(F) Python work over the frontier *perimeter* `F`, which is
far smaller than `N`. The scary-looking nested loops run over `F`, not `N`.

Options considered, with status:

- **A — skip the sigmoid.** Threshold `grid.log_odds` directly instead of
  calling `grid.probability()`, avoiding one `exp()` + divide over all `N`
  cells (~1 ms on the 250k-cell grid). Output is identical because probability
  is monotonic in log-odds.
  **Status: DEFERRED.** Costs readability (a magic `-0.405` vs a plain
  `p < 0.4`) and leaks grid's internal log-odds encoding into `frontier.py`,
  breaking the clean `probability()` seam. ~1 ms only matters if this is hot.
  Revisit **only if** Feature 4 profiling flags `detect_frontiers` as a
  hotspot (depends on whether the coordinator calls it every tick or only on
  reassignment).

- **B — reuse world coords.** In the representative-cell selection, reuse the
  `world` list already built for the centroid instead of calling
  `grid_to_world` a second time per cell. Pure win, no downside.
  **Status: APPLIED** (commit `a7d79d9`, PR #7).

- **C — incremental detection.** Recompute frontiers only near cells that
  changed this tick and cache the rest (O(N) → O(changed)). Real win, but adds
  dirty-region tracking + cache-invalidation complexity.
  **Status: DEFERRED (likely never).** Premature for 1–5 drones; CLAUDE.md:
  prefer the simple thing, measure first.

- **D — `scipy.ndimage.label` for clustering.** C-level connected components,
  faster than the hand-written BFS, but adds the scipy dependency.
  **Status: DECLINED.** Same scipy option already turned down in the clustering
  decision below; BFS over `F` cells is fast enough.

Guiding principle: **measure before optimizing; don't trade a clean seam or
readability for a millisecond without evidence.**

## 2026-08-01 — Frontier clustering algorithm (Sprint 2, Feature 1)

How to group frontier cells into regions. Options weighed: (a) hand-written BFS
connected-components, (b) `scipy.ndimage.label`, (c) `sklearn` DBSCAN.

**Decision: (a) hand-written BFS connected-components**, **8-connectivity**,
`min_region_size = 2`.

Why:
- **No new dependency** — scipy / scikit-learn are heavy and unneeded here.
- **Deterministic by construction** — a hard project requirement (same config +
  seed ⇒ identical run); BFS with fixed iteration/neighbor order guarantees it.
- **Simple** (~20 lines), full control — matches CLAUDE.md "prefer the simple
  thing."

Connectivity detail: the frontier *neighbor test* uses **4-connectivity** (the
standard frontier definition — free cell orthogonally adjacent to unknown),
while *clustering* uses **8-connectivity** so diagonally-touching frontier cells
merge into one region.
